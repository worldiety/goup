build:
  # We want a gomobile build, e.g. for ios or android
  gomobile:

    # the toolchain section is required to setup a stable gomobile building experience
    toolchain:
      # which go version?

      # which android ndk version?

      # The gomobile -o flag, this will be a folder

    # The export section defines all exported packages which are passed to gobind by gomobile.
    # Gomobile does not generate transitives exports, so you need to declare all
    # packages containing types and methods which you want to have bindings for.
    # Be careful with name conflicts, because the last part of the package will be used
    # to scope the types.
